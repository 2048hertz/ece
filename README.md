# Eusufzai Common Environment (ECE) for AdaOS

This is a customised version of XFCE made for AdaOS

The solution to convert XFCE into our version of it has been abandoned and a new solution to repackage XFCE with our customisations and installing that directly as a RPM  has been chosen.

**Old section:**

Files to turn plain XFCE into Ada's flavour of XFCE for AdaOS
To download AdaOS you must visit the central repository, links to all other repositories are there as well: https://github.com/2048hertz/AdaOS

UPDATE: This section is nearly stable. A few features are still missing though.

Dependencies:
- Orchis Theme
- Numix Icons
